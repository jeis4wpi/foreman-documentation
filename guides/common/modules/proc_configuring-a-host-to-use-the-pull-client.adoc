= Configuring a Host to Use the Pull Client

For {SmartProxies} configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode, hosts can subscribe to remote jobs using the remote execution pull client.
Managed hosts do not require an SSH connection to their {SmartProxyServer}.

.Prerequisites
* You have registered the host to {Project}.
* The {SmartProxy} through which the host is registered is configured to use `pull-mqtt` mode.
For more information, see {InstallingSmartProxyDocURL}configuring-remote-execution-for-pull-client_{smart-proxy-context}[Configuring Remote Execution for Pull Client] in _{InstallingSmartProxyDocTitle}_.

* The host can communicate with its {SmartProxy} over MQTT using port `1883`.
* The host can communicate with its {SmartProxy} over HTTPS using port `{smartproxy_port}`.

.Procedure
. Install the `katello-pull-transport-migrate` package on your host:
ifdef::client-content-dnf[]
* On {EL} 8 and {EL} 9 hosts:
+
----
# dnf install katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
* On {EL} 7 hosts:
+
----
# yum install katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
endif::[]
ifdef::client-content-apt[]
* On {Debian} hosts:
+
----
# apt-get install katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
endif::[]
ifdef::client-content-zypper[]
* On {SLES} hosts:
+
----
# zypper install katello-pull-transport-migrate
----
endif::[]

+
The package installs `foreman_ygg_worker` and `yggdrasil` as dependencies and enables the pull mode on the host.
The host's `subscription-manager` configuration and consumer certificates are used to configure the `yggdrasil` client on the host, and the pull mode client worker is started.
. Optional: To verify that the pull client is running and configured properly, check the status of the `yggdrasild` service:
+

----
# systemctl status yggdrasild
----
